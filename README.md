Overview
- This project analyzes women’s ecommerce sales data to uncover monthly revenue trends and SKU performance. 
- Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I transformed raw data into a dashboard that highlights growth patterns, product contributions, and actionable business insights.

Key Findings
- Revenue Trends: Revenue increased month‑to‑month, with September highest overall. Growth peaked in July (+8.9K) but slowed afterward.
- SKU Performance: SKU 799 led in both total revenue and average quantity (1.014), with SKU 708 also showing strong results.
- Growth Dynamics: While totals rose, the rate of growth declined after July — signaling a need for strategy adjustment.

Recommendations
- Replicate strategies behind top SKUs (799, 708).
- Research product features driving demand (bundles, styles, colors).
- Partner with complementary brands to lift mid‑tier SKUs.
- Discontinue consistently poor performers to focus resources on high‑ROI products.
